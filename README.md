# Introduction

Nowadays people usually have multiple audio devices like headsets/bluetooth devices etc. 
The way Windows handels them is pretty tricky - you have to manually select the audio output,
and it is hard to let the voice come out from multiple devices.

AudioBridge is my attempt to address this problem. As long as you have the "Stereo Mix" input
device enabled, you can stick to use the system speaker as the main output device, but send
the voice to all audio devices you want.
